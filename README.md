# LL(1) Predictive Parser

An LL(1) Predictive Parser is a top-down parsing technique used in compiler design to parse a subset of context-free grammars. The "LL(1)" refers to:
•	L: Left-to-right scanning of the input.
•	L: Leftmost derivation of the grammar.
•	1: One symbol of lookahead is used to make parsing decisions.
