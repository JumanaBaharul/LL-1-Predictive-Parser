# LL(1) Predictive Parser

An **LL(1) Predictive Parser** is a top-down parsing technique used in compiler design to parse a subset of context-free grammars.

The term **LL(1)** refers to:

- **L**: Left-to-right scanning of the input.
- **L**: Leftmost derivation of the grammar.
- **1**: One symbol of lookahead is used to make parsing decisions.

This type of parser uses a parsing table and stack to guide the parsing process, making it efficient for a certain class of grammars known as LL(1) grammars.
